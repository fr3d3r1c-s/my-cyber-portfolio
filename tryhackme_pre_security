# TryHackMe: Filesystem Interaction Continued

**Date Completed:** September 14, 2025

## Introduction

This lab is a continuation of our journey into the Linux filesystem. The objective is to learn and practice a set of fundamental commands that allow us to create, move, and delete files and directories.

Specifically, this write-up covers the following commands:

Command	Full Name	Purpose
touch	touch	Create a file
mkdir	make directory	Create a folder
cp	copy	Copy a file or folder
mv	move	Move a file or folder
rm	remove	Remove a file or folder
file	file	Determine the type of a file


Creating Files and Folders (touch, mkdir)
Creating files and folders on Linux is a simple process. The touch command takes one argument: the name we want to give the file. It's important to note that touch creates a blank file, which you would need to edit later with a command like echo or a text editor like nano.

Creating a new file with touch
tryhackme@linux2:~$ touch note

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls

Output:
folder1 note

The process is similar for making a directory. We use the mkdir command and provide the desired name.

Creating a new directory with mkdir
tryhackme@linux2:~$ mkdir mydirectory

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls

Output:
folder1 mydirectory note

Removing Files and Folders (rm)
The rm command is used to remove files and folders.

To remove a file, simply use rm followed by the file name.

Using rm to remove a file
tryhackme@linux2:~$ rm note

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls

Output:
folder1 mydirectory

To remove a directory, you must include the -R (recursive) switch alongside the rm command.

Using rm recursively to remove a directory
tryhackme@linux2:~$ rm -R mydirectory

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls

Output:
folder1

Copying and Moving Files and Folders (cp, mv)
Copying Files with cp
The cp command takes two arguments: the name of the existing file and the name for the new copy. It copies the entire contents of the existing file into the new one.

Using cp to copy a file
tryhackme@linux2:~$ cp note note2

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls

Output:
folder1 note note2

Moving and Renaming Files with mv
The mv command also takes two arguments. Rather than creating a copy, it moves or renames the file. The mv command can be used to move a file to a new folder or to rename it.

Using mv to move a file
tryhackme@linux2:~$ mv note2 note3

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls

Output:
folder1 note note3

Determining File Type (file)
The file command is essential for confirming the true nature of a file, as file extensions (like .txt) can be misleading or nonexistent. This command takes one argument.

Using file to determine the contents of a file
tryhackme@linux2:~$ file note

Output:
note: ASCII text

Summary and Key Takeaways
This lab provided a practical walkthrough of core Linux filesystem commands. We learned that:

touch and mkdir are used for creating files and directories.

rm is used for removing files, and requires the -R switch for directories.

cp is for copying files, while mv is used for moving or renaming them.

file is a crucial command for identifying a file's type and contents.

This knowledge is fundamental for effective navigation and management of a Linux environment.

Linux Directory Fundamentals
This is a summary of key Linux directories and their functions, based on the TryHackMe "Linux Fundamentals" lab.

/etc
The /etc directory is a central location for system configuration files.

It stores essential system files used by the operating system.

Notable files include:

sudoers: Contains a list of users and groups with permission to run commands with sudo.

passwd and shadow: These files manage user passwords, storing them in an encrypted format (sha512).

/var
The /var directory, short for "variable," stores data that is frequently written or accessed by services and applications.

It's a main root folder on a Linux installation.

Commonly stores log files in /var/log.

Also stores other data not associated with a specific user, like databases.

/root
Unlike the /home directory, /root is the home directory for the "root" system user.

This is the default location for the root user's personal files and configuration settings.

/tmp
The /tmp directory is a temporary, volatile folder.

Its contents are cleared out when the computer is restarted, similar to how RAM works.

By default, any user can write to this folder, making it a useful location for storing temporary files or scripts in a pentesting context.

Key Takeaways
This module provided an introduction to key Linux concepts:

Connecting to a Linux machine using SSH.

Using command flags and switches (e.g., man pages).

Interacting with the filesystem and its contents.

Understanding file permissions and switching users.
