Cyber Security 101: Information Evaluation and Search Techniques
This entry summarizes fundamental skills for effective learning and investigation in cybersecurity: evaluating information sources and utilizing advanced search techniques (OSINT fundamentals).

1. Evaluating Information Sources
When consuming information online (blogs, articles, wikis, etc.), rigorous evaluation is crucial as anyone can publish claims. Consider the following criteria:

Criterion	Description
Source	Identify the author or organization. Is the source reputable and authoritative on the subject?
Evidence & Reasoning	Are claims backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning? Look for hard facts, not just opinions.
Objectivity & Bias	Is the information presented impartially? Be wary of authors pushing a hidden agenda (e.g., product promotion, attacking a rival).
Corroboration	Validate the central claims by checking them against multiple independent, reliable sources.


⚠️ A cryptographic method or product considered bogus or fraudulent is often referred to as snake oil.

2. Advanced Search Operators (OSINT)
Internet search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo support advanced search operators to refine queries and conduct more effective investigations (a key part of OSINT - Open-Source Intelligence).

Key Google Search Operators
Operator	Syntax	Purpose	Example
Exact Phrase	"phrase"	Finds pages containing the exact word or phrase.	"passive reconnaissance"
Site	site:domain.com	Limits the search to a specific domain name.	site:tryhackme.com success stories
Omit Word	-word	Excludes search results that contain a particular word.	pyramids -tourism
File Type	filetype:ext	Searches specifically for files of a given type (e.g., pdf, doc, ppt).	filetype:pdf cyber warfare report

3. Command Line Utilities
The Linux command ss (which stands for socket statistics) is the modern utility that replaces the older netstat command for displaying network connections and socket information.
